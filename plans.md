Our Mission (instead of Hospitality & Residence):
Flip Inverted Arts Academy is one of the first academies to bring recreational gymnastics for kids and adults to Egypt.  Flip’s founder, Julia Alexan, is certified by USA Gymnastics and brings in many new concepts on how to teach and train gymnastics, different from what is typically found in Egypt. 

At Flip, we believe that you can instill athletics in kids at a young age through gymnastics by building their progress in a fun and friendly way that leaves them loving the sport, and it will leave a long-lasting positive effect on their lifelong concept of gymnastics, fitness and sports in general.  

Classes (instead of CORE Villas):
Recreational Gymnastics
Parkour
Competitive Aerobic Gymnastics
Adults Classes
Afterschool Programs

Events (instead of EXQUISITE INTERIORS):
We build self-confidence, determination and dedication in addition to strength, flexibility coordination and balance through our training and events.  We do not enter competitions, but we have two fun events per year, plus our Summer Sahel Program.  Our Spring Show, Winter Meet and Sahel Show are all end-of-season performances and friendly gymnastics challenges we use to show off our skills learned throughout the year.

Locations (instead of Exterior):
Our Gymnastics Program is open in Maadi, Zamalek, 6 October, New Cairo and Sheikh Zayed, with classes offered 2-3 days per week, ongoing all year round.  For more info on how to join, check us out on Instagram @flipinvertedarts.
